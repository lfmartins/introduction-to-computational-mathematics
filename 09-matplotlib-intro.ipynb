We will use this library in concert with NumPy, which we used in previous modules when introducing functions and arrays in Python. In this lesson we will work on plotting the data we generate in computational routine.\n",

For those with experience in Matlab, many of the functions have similar analogs in NumPy that are often using the same function call.
