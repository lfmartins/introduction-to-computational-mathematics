\section{Introduction}

This document describes a possible workflow for working on lessons and projects in the course. Although it is possible to download a Python distribution to your computer, it is recommended that students work in Google Colab and use Google Drive to store their notebooks.

This requires a Google Drive account. If you already have an existing Google account (for example, if you have a Gmail account), you are all set. If not, go to \url{https://drive.google.com} and create an account.

\section{Opening and Creating Notebooks}

\subsection{Lesson Notebooks}

All lesson notebooks in the course are available in BBLearn. To open a lesson, click on the link in BBLearn, and you will be automatically directed to Google Colab.

If you are not logged in Google, click the \textbf{Sign In} button shown in the picture below:

If you don't have a Google account, you will need to create one.

Once the notebook is opened and you are logged in Google Drive, click the button \textbf{Copy to Drive}, shown in the picture below:

\centeredimage{0.3}{colab-save-to-drive}

When prompted, click the \textbf{Open in New Tab} button, and a copy of the notebook will be opened in Google Drive. Any changes you make will be automatically saved.

From now on, you should do all the work in the copy of the lesson notebook. To open the notebook, click \textbf{File-Open notebook} in the Colab menu and select the notebook you want to open, as shown in the figure below:

\section{Project Notebooks}

To start working on a project, use a freshly created notebook. Go to Google Colab and select the menu item \textbf{File-New notebook}

The first thing to do with a project notebook is to change its name. Project notebooks must be named according to the following convention:

\begin{center}
\textbf{Project \# - Student Name - CSU ID}
\end{center}

For example, the notebook for Project 1 by Alice Mathperson, ID 1234567 should be named:

\begin{center}
\textbf{Project 1 - Alice Mathperson - 1234567}
\end{center}

To submit project solutions, it is necessary to download the notebook file in the appropriate format.

To download a notebook, select the Colab menu item \textbf{File - Download - Download to ipynb}, as shown in the figure below:

\centeredimage{0.3}{colab-download-ipynb}


The notebook is downloaded in \texttt{ipynb} format. This is a text format that is recognized by Jupyter, so it can be opened in a local installation of Jupyter. This is the format required for project submissions.
