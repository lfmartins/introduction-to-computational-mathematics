    "In this notebook, we explore Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for data classification. In this kind of problems, the data is organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An array `X` with a data point per row. We let $n_X$ be the number of data points, corresponding to the number of rows in `X`\n",
    "- For each datapoint, the values of observed _features_. The number of features is denoted bu $n_f$, and corresponds to the number of columns in `X`.\n",
    "- An array `y` of _labels_ or _targets_. Array `y` had $n_X$ rows. Entry `y[i]` represents the class to which data point $X[i]$ belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of classification is to define a _model_ that can accurately predict to which class a data point belongs, based on the values of the observed features.\n",
