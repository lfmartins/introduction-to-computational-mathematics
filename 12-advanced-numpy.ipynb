    "The `numpy` module is optimized for array operations that are frequently used in computational mathematics. This is supported by two features of `numpy` arrays: *vectorization* and *broadcasting*.\n",

    "Vectorization refers to operations and functions that operate \"in parallel\" on all elements of an array. This does not mean that the operations are actually done in parallel, but that `numpy` is able to do the operation using C loops, which are much faster than Python loops. Vectorization can also take advantage of CPU and GPU architectures that support parallelization.\n",
