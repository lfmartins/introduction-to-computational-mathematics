Jupyter and Python, together with special purpose libraries, provide a powerful platform for scientific computing, data analysis and machine learning. Computations in a Jupyter notebook can be easily shared, and colaboration can be as simple as emailing a text file or using a repository such as github. \n",

In our opinion, this is the most efficient way to learnn a new programming language, or being exposed to computer programming for the first time.\n",
