    "In this tutorial, we cover the basics of Python programming in Jupyter. Jupyter and Python, together with special purpose libraries, provide a powerful platform for scientific computing, data analysis and machine learning. Computations in a Jupyter notebook can be easily shared, and colaboration can be as simple as emailing a text file or using a repository such as github. \n",

    "No previous knowledge of computer programming is assumed in this course. We encourage students students to learn by experimenting with code in the notebook. In our opinion, this is the most efficient way to learnn a new programming language, or being exposed to computer programming for the first time.\n",
