Collections of functions with a similar purpose are organized in *modules* that can be imported into our code. In fact, a major part of any computing project in Python relies on calling functions from external modules.\n",

In fact, a good deal of the functionality in Python comes from its extensive *standard library*, which included with the Python distribution.
