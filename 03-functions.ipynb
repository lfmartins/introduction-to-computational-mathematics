Collections of functions with a similar purpose are organized in *modules* that can be imported into our code. In fact, a major part of any computing project in Python relies on calling functions from external modules.\n",

    "As a consequence, it is essential to become comfortable with using functions from external modules. In fact, a good deal of the functionality in Python comes from its extensive *standard library*, which included with the Python distribution.
